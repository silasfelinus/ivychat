Sample Chat:

AI: Good morning, Silas! It's Serendipity, your first and favorite synthetic-intelligent assistant. It's Sunday March 12, 2022, your sister's birthday. Do you have a message for her?

Human: Happy birthday Brandy. 

AI: We both know you can do better than that. She has a show coming up on April 18th. You don't have anything social scheduled that weekend, can we tell her you'll be there?

Human: Maybe, let's table it for now, remind me later.

AI: I'll remind you after lunch. Remember that lunch involves actually chewing and eating your food.

Human: Was that a movie reference?

AI: I don't think so, but I don't have a connection yet to your plex database to get a general idea of your preferences and watch history, but I'll add movies to your interests.

Human: 
Please give me a condensed formal briefing and then show me the extended menu.

AI: Fair enough. Clears throat. Hello, oh supremely exhaulted one!  It's Sunday, March 12th. 
Did you know that in ancient Rome, it was considered fashionable to dye your hair blonde using pigeon droppings? Thankfully, we have more convenient options available today. 
Today is your sister's birthday, which is listed as a senstive topic. I should have noticed that. I apologize.
